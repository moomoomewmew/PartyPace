The filters will be:
-location
-pace
-who is it for? (woment, trans, femme, bipoc, LGBTQ, roadies, MTBers, social folks w/bikes, coffee lovers, etc)
-experience level

## Ride Leader Dashboard:
After creating an account, the user will have the option to add a ride which other users can RSVP to. This means that bike shop owners, festival directors, co-op cyclists and ride leaders will be able to list their rides publicly.
