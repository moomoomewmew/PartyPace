## About
This website will allow users to search for group rides in their metro area while filtering for the right pace and company. It also allows account holders to add group ride events to the website, comment on local rides, and boost fun rides.
***


## Homepage:
The homepage will display the filters and once they recieve input will display the rides that match the filter below the filters.
The filters will be:
-location
-pace
-who is it for? (woment, trans, femme, bipoc, LGBTQ, roadies, MTBers, social folks w/bikes, coffee lovers, etc)
-experience level


## Ride Leader Dashboard:
After creating an account, the user will have the option to add a ride which other users can RSVP to. This means that bike shop owners, festival directors, co-op cyclists and ride leaders will be able to list their rides publicly.
