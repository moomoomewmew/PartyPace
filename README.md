# PartyPace
## A website for social cyclers 
### By: Katie Vermazani
***

## About
This website will allow users to add group ride events to the website, search local rides, and boost fun rides.
***

## Homepage:
The home page will display the most popular rides in the nation. It will also have a search bar so you can search for rides locally.

## Search page:
The search page will have results from their search on the home page as well as filters. The filters will be:
-location
-pace
-who is it for? (woment, trans, femme, bipoc, LGBTQ, roadies, MTBers, social folks w/bikes, coffee lovers, etc)

Perhaps there will be a quiz asking all of the filter questions to find the best rides for you.

## Ride Leader Page:
After creating an account, the user will have the option to add a ride which other users can RSVP to. This means that bike shop owners, festival directors, co-op cyclists and ride leaders will be able to list their rides publicly.
